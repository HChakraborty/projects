# Hangman game in python
I have used python for creating a game in python.
Instead of a fixed word, I have used a random function to chose a random value from a text file which contains around 3000 words.
I give the user a certain number of turns to guess the word.
You can choose the words from "HANGMAN WORDS" file or create your own new words in a text file. If you are using less words, then please change the range of random.randint().

# Tools used:
