# Hangman game in python
I have used python for creating a game in python.
Instead of a fixed word, I have used a random function to chose a random value from a text file which contains around 2999 words.
I give the user a certain number of turns to guess the word.
YOU CAN CHOOSE THE WORDS FROM "HANGMAN WORDS" FILE OR CREATE YOUR NEW WORDS IN A TEXT FILE. IF YOU ARE USING LESS WORDS, THEN PLEASE CHANGE THE RANGE OF random.randint().

# Tools used:
